This is a custom in-app feedback screen I developed during my time at Kaiser Permanente. It will be available to be used by any Kaiser Permanente iOS app. My goal was to create a screen that stayed true to Kaiser Permanente styling yet pushed the company’s UI design beyond the use of standardized iOS components by building custom components that introduced a much more fluid, interactive, and tactile feel through the use of animations and haptics. Take the pill cluster for example which playfully animates on appearance, calculating pill positions and animation delays on the fly ensuring harmonious formatting and fluid animations no matter the number/shape of pills. Form sections dynamically expand and shrink giving the screen a unified feel, contrasting the static and discordant UI’s more commonly used. 

This UI needed to meet rigorous standards such as full accessibility and voice over support, dynamic type support, accurate translations, as well as support for any screen size or orientation. In addition to these standards, I personally focused on creating a design at the intersection of beauty and functionality as I believe both qualities are necessary in order to create a truly good UI/UX.
